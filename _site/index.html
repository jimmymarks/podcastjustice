<p>Do you know what a podcast <em>is</em>?</p>

<p><a href="#yesIdo">Yes, I do</a><br />
<a href="#whatIsAPodcast">No, I don’t</a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-podcast">What is a Podcast?</h2>

<p>Podcasts are, simply put, audio programs put on by everyday people with something to say. Some are tightly edited and thoroughly produced. Others are more free-form, sort of like morning drive time radio shows.</p>

<p>Podcasts are almost always free, with a few exceptions. You can listen to podcasts online or, more likely, on your smartphone or audio device. Once you subscribe to a given podcast, you will get all new episodes of that podcast when they are released. You can unsubscribe at any time and there are no limits on how many podcasts you can choose - it’s up to you.</p>

<p>How can I help get you started?</p>

<h2 id="convince-me-to-like-podcasts">Convince Me to Like Podcasts</h2>

<p>Okay, well…huh. That’s tough.</p>

<p>See, podcasts are a form of entertainment. Like any other entertainment medium, they are wildly varied. Some are great and others, less so. What might appeal to a Rom-Com fan might not appeal to an Action movie buff. Jay-Z and Dolly Parton are both musicians, and each is turning out very different work. Neither is inherently “bad” or “good,” it’s all up to your tastes.</p>

<p>But as a rule, here’s what I like most about podcasting:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Minimal Editing</strong> – I like that podcasts aren’t held to the rigorous standards of TV and radio entertainment. Podcasts aren’t typically censored or coerced into one kind of content or another. Typically, when a podcast team is creating an episode of their show, they are doing what they want the way they want. There are exceptions, but I like that a podcast is self-selecting in what it presents to the world and in the way it presents it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Specialization</strong> – The podcasts I really love are often highly specialized. They have a very specific way of doing things and they stick to what they love. Can you imagine a podcast that’s all about pens? Or fun facts about bridges? Or people playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons? They’re out there. There are podcasts on nearly every subject, so there must be one that’s right for you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Equalization</strong> – If you have a device that can record audio, you can have a podcast. Period. Sure, it sounds better through a very expensive mic and with lots of plinky-plonky background music, but if that’s not what you have, well…so be it. Podcasts are open to anyone with something to say, and for anyone willing to listen. And if you’re a thirty-something middle-class cis-het white guy (like me), you can learn about the world around you…or rather, the world that isn’t. What a fascinating and wonderful thing.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Still not convinced? Well, I tried. Enjoy listening to your local morning shock jock on the way to work.</p>

<h2 id="i-dont-know-what-app-to-use">I Don’t Know What App to Use</h2>

<p>There are a number of ways to listen to podcasts. If you own an Apple device, you can download “Apple Podcasts” for free (it should come with iOS when you get your device, anyway). I have used Apple Podcasts and it’s…perfectly fine. But it’s not my go-to.</p>

<p><img src="" alt="Overcast App" /></p>

<p>The app I love is <a href="">Overcast</a> by <strong>Marco Arment</strong>. It has so many great features and you can get it for free from the App Store. If you upgrade to Premium, you can unlock additional features (which basically means you can turn off any advertisements in the app). You can also sync your podcasts across devices, collect them in lists you curate, and manage their speed and audio quality with ease. I swear, if you download this app you won’t regret it. It just gets better with time.</p>

<p>I can also recommend <a href="">Downcast</a>, another fine product. There are others who swear by Pocketcasts and other apps but I stick to Overcast because, well…stand by your man and all that.</p>

<p>For Android users, there’s Google Podcasts, DoggCast and even PocketCasts. Prices and mileage may vary, I’m not an Android Person.</p>

<p><img src="" alt="Spotify Audible" /></p>

<p>You can also get podcasts on many popular paid audio services, like Spotify and Audible. I feel a little icky about the idea of this because Spotify takes your money every month and the podcasters don’t get squat if you listen in Spotify. Granted, they don’t get squat from you anyway if you don’t donate to them or buy products with their offer codes in advertisements, but the dedicated podcasting apps are free and don’t charge you to use them. But if you really love Spotify and that’s how you get down, go for it I guess.</p>
